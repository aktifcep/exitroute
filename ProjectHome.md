Off the road ! is a game I played as a kid, and a friend re-learned me later.
Principle is quite easy : you have a hand-drawn circuit on which racers will compete. Each turn, you move your car to a new position depending on previous move (the previous move gives your old speed, and you can increase or decrease your speed by 1 each turn).

The aim of the project is to port this game to Android platform, and add a few features :
  * any number of players
  * level editor
  * weapons/bonus (nitro, super brakes, oil...)
  * and of course online games
